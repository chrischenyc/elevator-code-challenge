## Problem

> You are in charge of writing software for an elevator (lift) company.
> Your task is to write a program to control the travel of a lift for a 10 storey building.
> A passenger can summon the lift to go up or down from any floor. Once in the lift, they can choose the floor they'd like to travel to.
> Your program needs to plan the optimal set of instructions for the lift to travel, stop, and open its doors.
>
> Some test cases:
>
> - Passenger summons lift on the ground floor. Once in, chooses to go to level 5.
> - Passenger summons lift on level 6 to go down. A passenger on level 4 summons the lift to go down. They both choose L1.
> - Passenger 1 summons lift to go up from L2. Passenger 2 summons lift to go down from L4. Passenger 1 chooses to go to L6. Passenger 2 chooses to go to Ground Floor
> - Passenger 1 summons lift to go up from Ground. They choose L5. Passenger 2 summons lift to go down from L4. Passenger 3 summons lift to go down from L10. Passengers 2 and 3 choose to travel to Ground.

## Floor number convention

the solution assumes European/Australasian floor number convention, i.e.: floor 0 is G floor
